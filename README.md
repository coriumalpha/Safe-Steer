# 🛻 SafeSteer

## 🚀 Goals

- Develop a reactivity demonstrator that exemplifies the ability of a user interface (UI) to dynamically adapt to real-time changes.
- Utilize Akita as the State Manager to efficiently and scalably manage the application's state.
- Integrate the Material component library to ensure a consistent and high-quality look and user experience.
- Customize Material styles using SCSS with a vaporwave-inspired artistic style, creating a unique and visually appealing aesthetic.
- Deploy the testing environment on Azure using GitHub Actions and a Static App service, providing easy deployment and access to the demonstrator application.
- Use a JSON Server on an Azure App Service as the backend to efficiently handle data and provide a real-time experience.
- Demonstrate the reactivity of the UI by showcasing real-time changes in response to events, user interactions, or data updates from the JSON Server.
- Provide an interactive and engaging user experience, leveraging the features of Akita, Material, and the vaporwave-inspired custom style to create a visually striking and user-friendly interface.
